#boolean algebra
# #let's understand it with condition....
# #if the condition is right then it will print therwise it's not.., for example


# comparison operator
ankit_working_hour = 14
if ankit_working_hour ==12:
    print("average life")
    
if ankit_working_hour >= 12:
    print("life turns into stranger things")

#operators like + , - , >= , <= , < , >
